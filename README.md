# Dual-Axis Solar Tracker with Hybrid Control and Possibility of Full Rotation
## Abstract
  This invention presents a dual-axis solar tracker designed to increase the energy produced by solar panels. The control strategy combines both astronomical algorithms and optical sensors, ensuring efficient sun tracking without requiring constant activation of both actuators. The mechanical structure allows for 360-degree rotation around both axes, enabling accurate sun tracking even in non-optimal conditions like early morning, late afternoon, or specific geographical locations with significantly angled sunlight. Additionally, the tracker features modular and readily available mechanical and electronic components, simplifying assembly, installation, disassembly, and transportation while maintaining structural integrity.
## Technical Problems Addressed
Existing dual-axis solar trackers face challenges related to control strategy, panel rotation, and ease of assembly/installation. This invention addresses these issues by introducing a novel hybrid control strategy and a redesigned mechanical structure.
## Novelty and Unique Aspects
 - **Control Strategy**: The proposed hybrid control strategy ensures accurate sun tracking while minimizing actuator energy consumption by avoiding simultaneous operation of both actuators.
 - **Mechanical Design**: The new mechanical structure eliminates motion limitations, allowing for full rotation around both axes, enhancing sun tracking capabilities.
 - **Simplicity and Efficiency**: The modular design facilitates quick and straightforward assembly, installation, disassembly, and transportation, making the tracker user-friendly and cost-effective.
## Applications
This dual-axis solar tracker is suitable for residential, commercial, and industrial applications where maximum energy production from solar panels is desired. It provides a versatile solution for optimal solar energy harvesting in diverse geographical locations and climatic conditions.
